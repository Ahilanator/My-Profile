<h3>Interest in IT</h3>

<p>My interest in IT is particularly in social media platforms and how they evolve culture.

My interest in IT started when I got into E-Commerce.

I have a basic understanding of Java from a Udemy course and online web design platforms such as Wix, Shopify, and Squarespace. </p>

I decided to pursue studies online as I am a performing artist and can't attend class in person.

Having a desire to study online, I looked at my options on Open University Australia.

RMIT's IT course looked concise and the course contents looked extremely relevant to the industry.

RMIT also has a well-known reputation in the tech industry and has produced innovations and innovators throughout history. </p>

I expect to learn the basics of software development and computer science. How programs function and basic knowledge of how to build and work on an array of IT platforms. </p>

</p>

<h3>Ideal Job </h3>

<p>LinkedIn job opening at Meta (Formerly Facebook): <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2843875140"> Meta Job Listing On LinkedIn</a> </p>

<img src="https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/268272642_5152263338140860_137835951511428183_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=sy2LUo4uMzMAX_oHhoF&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=00_AT9SxGkL5zUmerdwbE13ij5JnCB2Lie8yM8ZAbsX8JpcaA&oe=61C3A655" width="461" height="1024">

<p>Meta (formerly Facebook) has the biggest platform on the internet.

Working there and learning the operations of such a platform would teach me about how digital platforms function.

This would help me greatly in the future when I attempt to build my own.</p>

<p>Programming experience is required such as Javascript and HTML with front-end experience.

Along with team abilities such as management, mentorship, and leadership.

Cross-sector relations to build and maintain new products is a fundamental role of this job.</p>

<p>I currently have experience in Java and HTML, designing web pages for e-commerce and business.

Having worked in business management I have the leadership and product development experience required to work this job.

I would need to improve on my programming and certain concepts such as asynchronous programming, closures, types, and ES6 along with React.

These I plan to learn on Udemy.com and various online courses along with the mobile application Mimo.</p>

<h3>Personality Profile</h3>

<p>

<ul>

I am an ENFP-T Which is an extroverted and intuitive personality.

This is because I am good with people and leadership and am able to sense the dynamics in group.

</ul>

<ul>

I am a Tactile learner and love learning hands-on, AKA being thrown in the deep end and learning how to do things as and when I need to. 

</ul>

<ul>

As a personal brand, I am an explorer, discovering new things and searching the horizon for wonders. 

</ul></p>

<p>I am an extroverted personality with a lot of intuition, also very hands-on and adventurous.

I love to learn new things on the frontier and apply them from the start. I do better with physical stimulation or practical exercises instead of reading documents online.</p>

<p>High amounts of energy and enthusiasm would be contributed, as well as creating a better environment for the team to function in.

There would be few dull moments in the team meetings. I would help the quieter and shy members of the group have a place to voice their opinion and be heard,

by creating a more comfortable team environment.

</p>

<p>Forming a team with less extroverted people and creating an atmosphere for them to express themselves, would be ideal.

If I pair up with solely extroverted people I feel there may be too much conversation and excitement to contain,

this may lead to less productivity and work output than desired.

This is why perhaps introverted people may pair better with me in a team environment, as I would help balance the group out.</p>

<h3>The EVA Wellness Assistant</h3>

<p> Mental health conditions currently affect 13% of the world's population. Due to the CoronaVirus pandemic and shelter in place requirements,

this is expected to increase in the future.

Although no device known can currently replace human contact and connection.

There needs to be a device that can check on your emotional and physical wellbeing and help improve it.

This can be done with the EVA AI wellness assistant.

The EVA will monitor your health through various sensors and a camera feed.

The device will detect your mood and suggest the most appropriate action to take for any given situation.

If you have been working too long and require a break, the EVA will prompt you and encourage you to relax.

This is a much-needed device for such a time as </p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The programming language the EVA will utilize is Python, this is because of its functionality and ease of use with object-orientated programming.

The Raspberry Pi hardware will have Python-based software which will be implemented.

This will allow the EVA to run every time the Raspberry Pi is turned on. <br></a> </p>

<p>The EVA wellness assistant runs on the Raspberry Pi 4 with the following specifications:</p>

<p>

Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz <br>

2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on model)<br>

2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE<br>

Gigabit Ethernet<br>

2 USB 3.0 ports; 2 USB 2.0 ports.<br>

Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin GPIO header (fully backward compatible with previous boards)<br>

2 × micro-HDMI ports (up to 4kp60 supported)<br>

2-lane MIPI DSI display port<br>

2-lane MIPI CSI camera port<br>

4-pole stereo audio and composite video port<br>

H.265 (4kp60 decode), H264 (1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode)<br>

OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.0<br>

Micro-SD card slot for loading operating system and data storage<br>

5V DC via USB-C connector (minimum 3A*)<br>

5V DC via GPIO header (minimum 3A*)<br>

Power over Ethernet (PoE) enabled (requires separate PoE HAT)<br>

Operating temperature: 0 – 50 degrees C ambient<br>

</p>

<p>Passive infrared (PIR) motion Sensors will be added to the EVA to detect how much movement the body is making while working, studying, or relaxing.

This can help detect anxiety/stress and general wellbeing. </p>

<p>

A Webcam will be attached to the Raspberry Pi interface as well, this will be ideally be situated above the user's face or in a place where the face can be seen frequently.

The EVA wellness assistant will be placed above the user's workspace where it can analyze and view the user as effectively as possible.

The webcam will help detect; sleep deprivation, dehydration, mental illness, frequent breaks from work.

</p>

<p>

DHT22 sensors will be utilized to monitor the temperature of your living/working environment,

this will help the EVA detect if your environment needs to be warmer or colder, depending on your mood and current needs.

For example, if you are highly energetic in the present moment perhaps a slightly cooler atmosphere would help you stay focused.

If you are feeling slightly fatigued a warmer temperature would be healthier for you in terms of easing your body into a rested state.

</p>

<h3>Features: </h3>

<h4>Contact List Emergency Dialing</h4>

<p>An emergency contact list will also be added into the EVA’s directory where she will be able to dial the person needed in case of an emergency.

The webcam detection software and motion sensors will be able to detect any erratic movement that may or not be an emergency situation, EVA will then prompt you if needed,

if the prompt is not answered after a few attempts the EVA will proceed to ring your closest Emergency contact via Internet phone dialing at Poptox.com.</p>

<h4>Music Mood Player</h4>

<p>The User's mood can be detected via facial recognition software via the Raspberry Pi Camera module utilizing; OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.

This will allow the EVA to play music or soundtracks depending on your mood to improve and or enhance your current state.</p>

<h4>Break Time Detection</h4>

<p>The EVA will be able to monitor how long you have been sitting still, using motion sensors and camera attachments.

She will recommend frequent breaks and these settings can be further customized.

The standard of a mini-break every 25 minutes according to the Pomodoro Technique will be the default system program.</p>

<h4>Sleep and Dehydration Deprivation Detection</h4>

<p>Sleep deprivation has a direct correlation to mental health and it is proven a lack of sleep can significantly affect mood and mental faculties.

The EVA will be able to sense if you are too tired to function or if you seriously require rest from the webcam and motion sensors.

Along with grading the scale of your skin’s complexion (especially around the lip and eye areas) to see if you are adequately hydrated,

suggest a hydration plan as part of the user experience.</p>

<h4>Mental Illness Detection</h4>

<p>If any unusual psychological outbursts occur, including those that may be part of a current mental condition,

The EVA can detect this and offer help or ring an emergency contact to assist you into a better mental state.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>

<p>The technology mentioned above would require the following software; Python, OpenCV, Tensor Flow, Keras as well as connection to wifi to function as intended.

The hardware is the Raspberry Pi 4, with the camera module, DH22 heat sensors, and PIR Infrared motion sensors. </p>

<h4>Skills and Testing Required</h4>

<p>A solid understanding of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning would be required with the Python programming language. I plan to learn this via Udemy.com,

where I can study an Artificial Intelligence course and learn the skills I require to program The EVA AI, wellbeing assistant.

Most of the software is open source and the code is published online for free. The hardware is readily available to be purchased on www.amazon.co.uk.

The main obstacles of this project will be user testing,

finding the most accurate way to extract data from the webcam and motion sensors feeds accurately to best help the individual.

This will take large amounts of trial and error with various test subjects, to gauge their sleep, dehydration, mood, and energy levels.</p>



<h3>The EVA Project Outcome</h3>

<p> When the project has reached the users that need it most;

people suffering from isolation from family and friends, individuals with a mental health diagnosis,

and any other individual who needs assistance to monitor how they are feeling because of their work-life balance.

For all these individuals, mental health will have significantly improved with consistent use of the EVA.

The basic daily habits and biological requirements of a healthy individual determine a large amount of their mental wellbeing.

I believe this device can enforce healthy behaviors daily and make a drastic difference in people's lives. </p>
